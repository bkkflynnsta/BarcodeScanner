The BarcodeScanner app for iOS is a practice project introducing learners to SwiftUI
concepts, structures, and approaches.  I highly recommend this FREE course for
beginner to intermediate Apple developers, especially those newer to SwiftUI.

Sean Allen does a commendable job introducing the language, covering pros and
cons of SwiftUI, and provides solid, experience-backed tutorial on using the
most popular features of SwiftUI to build great looking apps and easily-readable
code.

This is my own customized result based on Sean's code, with some challenges
accepted to extend the functionality of the BarcodeScanner app, including:

- Building an Coordinator interface to a UIViewController to access the camera
- Creating the Delegate logic to the UIViewController
- Returning a barcode string from the UIViewController to SwiftUI

Please feel free to clone or fork this project - I think there's a lot of room
for improvement

Enjoy!
